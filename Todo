HTML::Bare Todo

0.04
  [] Allow which node names auto-close to be configurable
  [] Add tests for "parsing until root node is complete" feature
  [] Investigate why segfaults can occur if closing nodes exist before opening nodes

0.03
  [] Write better tests for utf8 support.
  [] Write code capable of parsing encoding besides basic ascii and utf8. It's messy but should be useful to some people.

0.02
  [] Add an 'inner' function to fetch just the raw inner contents of a node
  [] Provide a way to store/keep track of original input text so that the 'raw'
     function can still work when multi part parsing is done.
  [head] Allow a specific set of tagnames to be auto-closing
  [] Create an efficient way to handle entities ( A long desired feature by many
     people for XML::Bare... )
  [] Alter the parsing engine to store all intermediary values, because unlike
     XML typically mixed values have meaning.
  [] Revamp the module to use Tied hashes instead of real hashes so that you
     can properly navigate around the tree, and also so that nodes can be read in
     order with properly mixed content.
  [] Add in recognition of nodes that require special parsing such as CSS and JS
     [] Simply skip through them looking for a corresponding end node
     [] Actually parse CSS
     [] Actually parse JS
  [] Parse and store doctype meaningfully
  [] Add a function to efficientlly go through a string and strip extra spacing
     since many times extra spacing in HTML is meaningless
  [] Benchmark the HTML parser against other libraries
     Currently the included bench folder is just a copy from XML::Bare.

0.01
  [head] Allow multi part parsing to work again by way of a serialized name stack
     that can be reinitiated.
  [] Alter the tests to be reasonable for HTML processing instead of just copies
     of the original XML tests
