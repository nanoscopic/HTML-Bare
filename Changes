HTML::Bare Changelog

0.03
  - Remove utf8 tests entirely as they were written by Nigel Metheringham and taint the license and copyright of the project.
    New tests will be written that are sensible and do not break on specific perl versions.
  - Change license of the project to AGPL to prevent commerical usage as a service.

0.02
  - Correct bugs related to self closing nodes. ( name stack was not being properly maintained for them )
  - Add a unit test, Bug_self_closing.t, to test fixed bugs
  - Fix existing bug carried over from XML::Bare regarding incorrect _z values
  - Create a new function 'raw' to give you the original string of text for a specific node.
    This is important for HTML as the exact contents of nodes are often useful.
